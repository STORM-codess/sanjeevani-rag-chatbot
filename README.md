🌿 Sanjeevani – AI-Powered RAG Chatbot for the Ayurvedic & Farming Ecosystem

(Freelancing Project | Real-World Problem Solving)

Sanjeevani is a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot platform built as a freelancing project to solve real-world challenges faced by farmers, Ayurvedic stakeholders, and supply-chain participants.

The platform delivers transparent, verifiable, and context-aware information using modern AI techniques, with a strong focus on usability, traceability, and inclusivity.

🚜 Problem Statement (Real-World Context)

Farmers and Ayurvedic supply-chain stakeholders often face:

Fragmented and unreliable information

Lack of transparency in quality verification and batch traceability

Language barriers and poor digital accessibility

Difficulty accessing schemes, incentives, and grievance mechanisms

Sanjeevani addresses these issues by providing a grounded AI assistant that retrieves answers strictly from verified documents, ensuring trust, accuracy, and accountability.
